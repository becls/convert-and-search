@nosafety

## swish/web/app/addDatabase.ss

@fixed You could use the symbols bad-database and browser-add
  instead of the single-element vectors containing the symbols. It's
  simpler and faster this way.

  The same goes for invalid-type in saved.ss. See also errors raised in search.ss.

@fixed Initial is misspelled here and in saveSearch.ss, search.ss,
  twoTableSearch.ss, and js/query-db.ss.

## swish/web/app/components.ss

@fixed Use the transaction form when doing quick queries against the log-db:

  (define (get-database-name)
    (match (transaction 'log-db
             (execute "select name from database where file_path = ?"
               (user-log-path)))
      [(#(,name)) `(p ,name)]
      [() '(p "None selected")]))

## swish/web/app/confirm-delete.ss

@fixed Don't shadow the system display procedure.

@fixed `(if value value "")` is equivalent to `(or value "")`.

@fixed On line 79, use (br) instead of `\n` to break a line.

@fixed Use `(transaction 'log-db (execute ...))` instead of
  `(db:transaction 'log-db (lambda () (execute ...)))`. Same elsewhere
  including saveSearch.ss.

## swish/web/app/search.ss

@defect Call do-query with apply so that the rest arguments are placed
  correctly. Also, use remq for convenience:

  (define (do-query-cleanup db sql limit offset type f . bindings)
    (apply do-query db sql limit offset type f (remq "" bindings)))

  The removal of empty-string bindings doesn't seem right because bindings are ordered.
:fix: Used suggested code. The empty sting-bindings are unused parameters, which are never put into the string, see construct-sql

@suggestion Combine these two lines since str is used nowhere else:
  [,str (sqlite:expanded-sql stmt)]
  [,no-limit (remove-limit-offest str)]
:fix: Fixed as described in displayQuery, think was in the wrong section.

## swish/web/app/displayQuery.ss

@fixed do-query doesn't handle the rest argument bindings correctly. Instead
  of `(if (null? bindings) (list limit offset) (append (car bindings) (list limit offset)))`,
  do `(append bindings (list limit offset))`.

@fixed remove-limit-offset is misspelled.

@fixed Wouldn't it be better to remove the limit & offset from
  the end in case limit is in the query string somewhere?
  `(pregexp-match "^(.+) limit \d+ offset \d+$" str)`

@defect The `f` argument to `do-query` is not used.
:reject: It is passed to data->html-table where it is used. However, I fixed the shadowing in get-results

## swish/web/app/css/components.css
@fixed
  From https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator:
  Line 29: background-position only 0 can be a length. You must put a unit after your number: 0 -30
  Line 190: background-color FFA0AF is not a background-color value

## swish/web/app/js/components.js

@fixed Run JSHint.com and fix the warnings. Check all the other javascript files, too.

## swish/web/app/js/drop.js

@defect strUser, updateFeild, and updateOtherFeild are unused. (Field
  is misspelled.) Missing a semicolon on line 29.
:fix: Apparently I am bad at removing unused files. This whole file is unused because it was using in a .ss file create purely to simplify code when I was figuring out how to do something. Final fix: deleted whole file

## swish/web/app/js/resize.js

@fixed Remove unnecessary semicolon from line 3.

## swish/web/app/js/query-db.js

@fixed Field is misspelled. Fix uses of this in the rest of the
  code. Line 99 is missing a semicolon.

## swish/web/app/export.ss

@fixed Typos
  "the instruction below" => "the instructions below"
  "excel" => "Excel"
  "grayed out" => "greyed out" (preferred spelling)
  
@fixed Use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost.

@fixed The indentation of parts of the results procedure is off.

## swish/web/app/filter.ss

@fixed Line 37: the sentence should end with a period.

## swish/web/app/saved.ss

@fixed  "excel" => "Excel"

## swish/web/app/updatePath.ss

@fixed "computer's memory" => "computer" and "Remove now?" => "Remove this entry now?"
